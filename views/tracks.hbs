Create the View tracks link on the albums page. This link should take you to a page with a list of all of the tracks on a particular album.

Hint: The link to the tracks page should have each album's id in it.
Note: âš¡ Check out the .getAlbumTracks() method in the spotify-web-api-node documentation.

A track object comes with a preview_url, which is the source for a 30-second preview of a particular song. You can plug this into an HTML audio tag, and it will play the preview.
